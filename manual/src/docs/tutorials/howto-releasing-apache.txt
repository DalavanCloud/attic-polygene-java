[[releasing-apache,Releasing Polygene]]
= Releasing Polygene™

[WARNING]
====
You need a unix-like environment to actually perform the release process.
This tutorial is known to work on Linux and Mac.
====

This tutorial is intended for Apache Polygene™ commiters who want to release a new version of Apache Polygene™ (Java Edition) at The Apache Software Foundation.
It describes the tools and processes of a typical release.

It is intended to be a recommendation of best practices for the Apache Polygene™ project.
The instructions provided here are consistent with, but not a replacement for the https://www.apache.org/dev/release.html[ASF Release Guidelines].


== TL;DR

- Build and publish/stage release candidate bits
- VOTE thread
    - NO: clean things up
    - YES: promote the release candidate bits as final and update all properties


== Preparing a release


=== Select a Release Manager

A Polygene committer (normally one of the development team) should post an email to the development list proposing that a release be made and nominating a release manager.
Typically, the proposer volunteers as the release manager and it passes by https://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#LazyConsensus[lazy consensus].


=== Clone/Checkout all repositories

Clone/checkout all needed repositories, next to each other:

[source,shell]
----
mkdir polygene-repos
cd polygene-repos
git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/polygene-java.git polygene-java
git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/polygene-website.git polygene-website
cd polygene-website
git checkout asf-site
cd ..
svn checkout --depth empty https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/ polygene-dist
cd polygene-dist
svn update --set-depth immediates dev
svn update --set-depth immediates release
svn update --set-depth infinity dev/polygene
svn update --set-depth infinity release/polygene
cd ..

----

You should then get the following directory tree:

[source,text]
----
.
└── polygene-repos
    ├── polygene-java           # Apache Polygene™ (Java Edition) source
    ├── polygene-website        # https://polygene.apache.org/ website
    └── polygene-dist
        ├── dev
        |   └── polygene        # Releases candidate distributions
        └── release
            └── polygene        # Releases distributions
----


[TIP]
====
From now on, all command line snippets start from the `polygene-repos` directory.
====


=== Build Apache Polygene™ (Java Edition)

Ensure you can test, build Apache Polygene™ (Java Edition), including the documentation minisite generation using Asciidoc and artifact signing.

Here is what should pass before going further:

[source,shell]
----
cd polygene-java
git checkout develop
./gradlew -Dversion="<RELEASE-VERSION>" checkDistributions
----

See the <<build-system, Build System>> tutorial for details.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Also ensure that the link:https://builds.apache.org/view/P/view/Polygene/job/Polygene(JavaEdition)-develop-java8-checkDists/[`checkDists`] CI build is passing.
====

=== Install Jekyll

Moreover, you will need to have a valid http://jekyllrb.com/[Jekyll] installation as the Apache Polygene™ https://polygene.apache.org/[website] is generated using it.


=== Setup git flow

`git-flow` is a git extension that add git commands to easily use the git flow branching model the Apache Polygene™ project follows.
See the https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/wiki/Installation[installation instructions].


=== Setup git signing

Ensure you can sign git tags.

[source,shell]
----
git config --global user.signingkey <YOUR-PGP-ID>
----

See the https://git-scm.com/book/tr/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work[Git Tools - Signing Your Work] section of the Git book.


=== Setup Apache Nexus credentials

See the Apache https://www.apache.org/dev/publishing-maven-artifacts.html[Publishing Maven Artifacts] guide and the Apache Polygene™ (Java Edition) <<build-system,Build System>> tutorial.


=== Setup nodejs and NPM registry credentials

First, https://nodejs.org/en/download/[install NodeJS].

If you don't have a `npmjs.org` user yet, create one now:

[source,shell]
----
npm adduser
----

If your `npmjs.org` user is not registered as a maintainer for the
https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-polygene[generator-polygene] package, ask for the privilege on
`dev@polygene.apache.org`.


=== Update the `KEYS` files if needed.

The reference `KEYS` file can be found at the `polygene-java` repository's root, that is `polygene-java/KEYS`.
Ensure that it contains your public key.

Next, diff it against the ones present in the `dev` and `release` distribution areas:

[source,shell]
----
diff polygene-java/KEYS polygene-dist/dev/polygene/KEYS
diff polygene-java/KEYS polygene-dist/release/polygene/KEYS
----

And update them if needed:

[source,shell]
----
cp polygene-java/KEYS polygene-dist/dev/polygene/KEYS
cp polygene-java/KEYS polygene-dist/release/polygene/KEYS
cd polygene-dist/dev/polygene
svn add dev/polygene/KEYS release/polygene/KEYS
svn commit -m "polygene: updating Polygene KEYS"
----



== Creating a Release Candidate


=== Resolve JIRA issues

Resolve all issues on that version!
They can be resolved by:

- fixing
- marking them as `INVALID` or `WONTFIX`
- changing their fix version to another unreleased version

See the https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/POLYGENE[POLYGENE] project on JIRA.


=== Prepare Release-Notes

Apache Polygene™ release-notes are generated from JIRA issues.

Open the target Polygene™ version's release-notes in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/POLYGENE/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:roadmap-panel[JIRA] and review them.

JIRA can produces release-notes as HTML or plain-text.
Set it up to generate plain-text release-notes.

We will need these in several formats.
Starting from the plain-text one we will generate the others.

First save the text-plain release-notes in a file named `apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-release-notes.txt`.
A good place for this file would be in the `polygene-repos` directory created earlier, alongside all repositories.

Convert to Asciidoc:

[source,shell]
----
cat "apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-release-notes.txt" | \
  sed -e "s/\[POLYGENE-\([0-9]\)*\]/https:\/\/issues.apache.org\/jira\/browse\/POLYGENE-\1[POLYGENE-\1]/" | \
  sed -e "s/    \* /- /" | sed -e "s/^\*\*/====/" \
  > "apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-release-notes.adoc"
----

Convert to Markdown:

[source,shell]
----
cat "apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-release-notes.txt" | \
  sed -e "s/\[POLYGENE-\([0-9]*\)\]/[POLYGENE-\1](https:\/\/issues.apache.org\/jira\/browse\/POLYGENE-\1)/" | \
  sed -e "s/    \* /- /" | sed -e "s/^\*\*/####/" \
  > "apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-release-notes.md"
----

You should then have the following files:

[source,shell]
----
.
├── apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-release-notes.txt
├── apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-release-notes.adoc
└── apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-release-notes.md
----

We will use them later.


=== Create a RC branch

We use `<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#` where `RELEASE-VERSION` is the target release version and `RC#` for Release Candidate and an incremental number in case the release process has to be done several times.

[source,shell]
----
cd polygene-java
git flow release start "<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#"
----

This will eventually generates a `<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#` tag that we will amend with a `<RELEASE-VERSION>` signed tag if the vote passes, see below.


=== Audit artifacts and distributions

Make a complete build, deploying maven artifacts locally:

[source,shell]
----
cd polygene-java
./gradlew -Dversion="<RELEASE-VERSION>" assemble
----

Review maven artifacts in `distributions/build/stage/maven-binaries`.

Also review the release distributions in `distributions/build/distributions` where you should find the following files:

[source,shell]
----
.
├── apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-src.tgz
├── apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-src.tgz.MD5
├── apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-src.tgz.SHA-512
├── apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-src.tgz.asc
├── apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-src.zip
├── apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-src.zip.MD5
├── apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-src.zip.SHA-512
└── apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-src.zip.asc
----

If any, make the required changes, commit them and iterate.


=== Close the RC branch

Once you are satisfied with the produced artifacts, close the release candidate branch:

[source,shell]
----
cd polygene-java
git flow release finish "<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#"
----


=== Checkout the RC tag

To build the release candidate bits, we need to checkout the release candidate tag, that will eventually be promoted as a signed release tag, because the Apache Polygene™ build system generates versionning information based on git metadata.

[source,shell]
----
cd polygene-java
git checkout "<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#"
----


=== Build RC artifacts and distributions

[source,shell]
----
cd polygene-java
./gradlew -Dversion="<RELEASE-VERSION>" clean assemble
----


=== Stage RC maven artifacts

Stage artifacts to https://repository.apache.org/[repository.apache.org] :

[source,shell]
----
cd polygene-java
./gradlew -Dversion="<RELEASE-VERSION>" uploadArchives
----

Close the staging Nexus repository by following the https://www.apache.org/dev/publishing-maven-artifacts.html#close-stage[Closing the staged repository] guide.


=== Stage NPM registry packages

Publish the new version of the `generator-polygene` NPM package tagged as `beta`:

[source,shell]
----
cd polygene-java
./gradlew tools:generator-polygene:prepareTemplateGradleWrapper
cd tools/generator-polygene
npm publish --tag beta
----

If the release VOTE passes, we'll remove the `beta` tag, making the new version available.

Then open https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-polygene[https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-polygene] to check
that the new version was published and is tagged as `beta`.


=== Upload RC distributions

Source distribution, checksums and signatures must be uploaded to https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/polygene/[dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/polygene].
This build created these in the `buid/distributions` directory, named `apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-src*.*`.
As this release still is a simple candidate, we'll rename them before upload to advertise this in their names.

[source,shell]
----
# Source ZIP
cp "polygene-java/distributions/build/distributions/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-src.zip" \
   "polygene-dist/dev/polygene/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#-src.zip"
cp "polygene-java/distributions/build/distributions/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-src.zip.MD5" \
   "polygene-dist/dev/polygene/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#-src.zip.MD5"
cp "polygene-java/distributions/build/distributions/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-src.zip.SHA-512" \

cp "polygene-java/distributions/build/distributions/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-src.zip.asc" \
   "polygene-dist/dev/polygene/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#-src.zip.asc"
# Source TAR.GZ
cp "polygene-java/distributions/build/distributions/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-src.tgz" \

cp "polygene-java/distributions/build/distributions/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-src.tgz.MD5" \
   "polygene-dist/dev/polygene/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#-src.tgz.MD5"
cp "polygene-java/distributions/build/distributions/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-src.tgz.SHA-512" \

cp "polygene-java/distributions/build/distributions/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-src.tgz.asc" \
   "polygene-dist/dev/polygene/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#-src.tgz.asc"
----

And then upload them:

[source,shell]
----
cd polygene-dist/dev/polygene
svn add * --force
svn commit -m "polygene: upload <RELEASE-VERSION>-RC# to dist/dev/polygene"
----


== Run the vote

Send a "VOTE" to the mailto:dev@polygene.apache.org[developer mailing list] including links to release artifacts. A VOTE always contains two parts. Send an email to the developer mailing list with the subject line:

----

Votes on whether a package is ready to be released use majority approval -- i.e., at least three PMC members must vote affirmatively for release, and there must be more positive than negative votes.



== Verifying a Release Candidate

In order to verify a Apache Polygene™ (Java Edition) release candidate you'll need valid `wget`, `md5sum`, `shasum` with support for SHA-5.12, GnuPG and Java JDK >= 7 installations.

If the setup feels like a chore, keep reading, you probably already have what's needed for some of the checks.
A single check is better than none.


=== Download RC

First go downloading the release candidate distributions from https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/polygene/[dist.a.o/repos/dist/dev/polygene].
Including `*.MD5`, `*.SHA-512` and `*.asc` files.
Put them in a directory:

[source,shell]
----
cd polygene-check-rc
wget https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/polygene/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#-src.tgz
wget https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/polygene/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#-src.tgz.MD5
wget https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/polygene/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#-src.tgz.SHA-512
wget https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/polygene/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#-src.tgz.asc
wget https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/polygene/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#-src.zip
wget https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/polygene/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#-src.zip.MD5
wget https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/polygene/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#-src.zip.SHA-512
wget https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/polygene/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#-src.zip.asc
----


=== Verify RC signatures

Verify PGP signatures:

[source,shell]
----
cd polygene-check-rc
gpg apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#-src.tgz.asc
gpg apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#-src.zip.asc
----

This must output `gpg: Good signature from "Signer Name <signer@ema.il>"` for each distribution.


Verify MD5 checksum:

[source,shell]
----
cd polygene-check-rc
echo "$(cat apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#-src.tgz.MD5) apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#-src.tgz" | md5sum -c -
echo "$(cat apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#-src.zip.MD5) apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#-src.zip" | md5sum -c -
----

This must output `some-filename: OK` for each distribution.


Verify SHA-512 checksum:

[source,shell]
----
cd polygene-check-rc
echo "$(cat apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#-src.tgz.MD5)  apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#-src.tgz" | shasum -a 512 -c -
echo "$(cat apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#-src.zip.MD5)  apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#-src.zip" | shasum -a 512 -c -
----

This also must output `some-filename: OK` for each distribution.


=== Verify source distribution

Unpack the source distributions, we will use the `zip` distribution here, both should be checked.

[source,shell]
----
cd polygene-check-rc
unzip apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#-src.zip
cd apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#-src
----


*LICENSE & NOTICE*

Review `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` file(s) ;
see the Apache's https://www.apache.org/dev/licensing-howto.html[Licensing Howto].

Tools like https://creadur.apache.org/rat/[Apache Rat™] and other projects from https://creadur.apache.org/[Apache Creadur™] can come in handy.
You can also `grep` the whole source tree.


*Build RC from sources*

[source,shell]
----
cd polygene-check-rc/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#-src
./gradlew assemble check
----


== VOTE passes


=== Seal the release

Create and sign the release git tag from the unsigned release candidate tag:

[source,shell]
----
cd polygene-java
git tag -s "<RELEASE-VERSION>" "<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#"
----

Push all git changes:

[source,shell]
----
cd polygene-java
git checkout master
git push origin master
git checkout develop
git push origin master
git push origin --tags
----


=== Publish bits

Promote the staged Nexus repository so it gets synched to Maven Central by following the https://www.apache.org/dev/publishing-maven-artifacts.html#promote[Promoting a repo] guide.

Move the release distributions, checksums and signatures from https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/polygene/[polygene-dist/dev/polygene] to https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/polygene/[polygene-dist/release/polygene]:

[source,shell]
----
cd polygene-dist
# Source ZIP TODO
export DIST_DEV_URL="https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/polygene"
export DIST_RELEASE_URL="https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/polygene"
svn move "$DIST_DEV_URL/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#-src.zip" \
     "$DIST_RELEASE_URL/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-src.zip" \
     -m "polygene: promoting release <RELEASE-VERSION> distributions"
svn move "$DIST_DEV_URL/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#-src.zip.MD5" \
     "$DIST_RELEASE_URL/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-src.zip.MD5" \
     -m "polygene: promoting release <RELEASE-VERSION> distributions"
svn move "$DIST_DEV_URL/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#-src.zip.SHA-512" \
     "$DIST_RELEASE_URL/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-src.zip.SHA-512" \
     -m "polygene: promoting release <RELEASE-VERSION> distributions"
svn move "$DIST_DEV_URL/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#-src.zip.asc" \
     "$DIST_RELEASE_URL/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-src.zip.asc" \
     -m "polygene: promoting release <RELEASE-VERSION> distributions"
# Source TAR.GZ
svn move "$DIST_DEV_URL/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#-src.tgz" \
     "$DIST_RELEASE_URL/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-src.tgz" \
     -m "polygene: promoting release <RELEASE-VERSION> distributions"
svn move "$DIST_DEV_URL/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#-src.tgz.MD5" \
     "$DIST_RELEASE_URL/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-src.tgz.MD5" \
     -m "polygene: promoting release <RELEASE-VERSION> distributions"
svn move "$DIST_DEV_URL/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#-src.tgz.SHA-512" \
     "$DIST_RELEASE_URL/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-src.tgz.SHA-512" \
     -m "polygene: promoting release <RELEASE-VERSION> distributions"
svn move "$DIST_DEV_URL/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#-src.tgz.asc" \
     "$DIST_RELEASE_URL/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-src.tgz.asc" \
     -m "polygene: promoting release <RELEASE-VERSION> distributions"
----

This produces one commit per file but keep svn history and runs fast, without re-uploading the distributions.


=== Wait 24 hours

For mirrors to pick up the new bits.


=== Prepare an announcement

Coordinate a press release with press@apache.org.

    TODO

You can reuse the release-notes content from the `txt`/`adoc`/`md` files created earlier.

This annoucement will be used in a variety of media like emails, websites etc...
Start with a text version and once satisfied create at least a Markdown version for the website, see below.


=== Publish `generator-polygene` to the NPM registry

[source,shell]
----
npm dist-tag rm generator-polygene beta
----

Then open https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-polygene[https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-polygene] to check
that the package is not tagged as `beta` anymore.


=== Update the Polygene™ website

Generate the documentation and javadoc minisite:

[source,shell]
----
cd polygene-java
./gradlew -Dversion="<RELEASE-VERSION>" copyAsfDocumentation
----

This will automatically put all files into the `polygene-website` website repository.

Create a new post on the Polygene™ website by creating a new Markdown file:

[source,shell]
----
cd polygene-website
touch "src/_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>.md"
open !$
----

You can reuse the Markdown formatted announcement content.

Add the new released version in `polygene-website/content/java/versions.json` below the `latest` entry:

[source,js]
----
{
    "develop": "develop",
    "latest": "latest",
    "<RELEASE-VERSION>", "<RELEASE-VERSION>",
    "3.0.0": "3.0.0",
    "2.1": "2.1",
    "2.0": "2.0",
    "<=1.4.x": "1.4"
}
----

Finally, edit `polygene-website/src/_data/releases.yml` with the new release data.
Upmost is the latest:

[source,text]
----
- version: <RELEASE-VERSION>
  published: true
  announcement: YYYY/MM/DD/apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>
  signer: John Doe
  pgpId: FB751943
----

You can run the Polygene™ website locally:

[source,shell]
----
cd polygene-website
jekyll serve
----

Open http://127.0.0.1:4000/[http://127.0.0.1:4000/] to live-preview your changes.

Once you are satisfied with the changes, build the production website:

[source,shell]
----
cd polygene-website
jekyll build
----

Link `/latest` to the latest release:

[source,shell]
----
cd polygene-website/content/java
ln -s <RELEASE_VERSION> latest
----

And publish it:

[source,shell]
----
cd polygene-website
git add .
git commit -m "update website"
git push
----


=== Register the release

Register the new release at https://reporter.apache.org/[reporter.apache.org]


=== Announce

Finally, send an announcement to mailto:dev@polygene.apache.org[dev@] mailing list. Email announcements should have the subject line:

[source,text]
----
[ANNOUNCE] Released Polygene (Java Edition) version <RELEASE-VERSION>
----

The announcement email should contains the release-notes as text, remember they are in the `apache-polygene-java-<RELEASE-VERSION>-release-notes.txt` file you created earlier.



== VOTE fails or is cancelled


=== Record failure

We keep the release candidate git history.
It can be useful for reviewers to have access to it.
Remember, we created a release candidate branch and tags, no signed release tag.

[source,shell]
----
cd polygene-java
git checkout master
git push origin master
git checkout develop
git push origin master
git push origin --tags
----


=== Drop RC artifacts and distributions

Drop the Nexus staging repository by following the https://www.apache.org/dev/publishing-maven-artifacts.html#drop[Dropping a repo] guide.

Drop distributions, checksums and signatures from https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/polygene/[polygene-dist/dev/polygene]

[source,shell]
----
cd polygene-dist/dev/polygene/
svn rm "*<RELEASE-VERSION>-RC#*.*"
svn commit -m "polygene: dropping <RELEASE-VERSION>-RC# from dist/dev/polygene as the vote failed/was cancelled"
----

Drop NPM packages:

[source,shell]
----
