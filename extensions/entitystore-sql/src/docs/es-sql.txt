[[extension-es-jooq,SQL EntityStore]]
= ORM EntityStore =

[devstatus]
--------------
source=extensions/entitystore-jooq/dev-status.xml
--------------

This entitystore is backed by a SQL server, and maps each mixin type of the Composite into separate tables. This is more
enterprise-friendly, but comes at the cost of less performance compared to the <<extension-es-sql>>.

This extension fully leverage the <<library-sql>> meaning that you must use it to assemble your DataSource and that you
get <<library-circuitbreaker,Circuit Breaker>> and <<library-jmx, JMX>> integration for free.
